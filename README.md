## Description of the project
When I first started studying algorithms,
it was difficult for me to figure out what they were
for and where to use them in general. It was only
after a long time that I was able to solve the most
primitive Medium tasks on. That's why I created this site 
to make it easier for novice programmers to enter 
such an amazing and beautiful world of algorithms.

## Getting started

Using these instructions, you will be able to run a copy of the project on your local computer for development and testing purposes.

### Preliminary requirements

```
git clone https://github.com/DKMFzF/mesto-project-ff.git
```

### Installation

A step-by-step series of examples that explain how to run a development environment

To start, open a terminal in your repository where the project is hosted and enter the following command

```
npm install
```

And repeat
